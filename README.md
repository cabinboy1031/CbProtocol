# CbProtocol
A VERY naiive implementation of a basic JSON protocol in java.

## Basic usage
__BEGIN_MSG__
{ "example": "Any json data can work as long as there is an associated object to it" }
__END_MSG__

Only really meant for me specifically. 
its supposed to work with sockets in order for C++ projects to interact with any data i want accessed from java.
